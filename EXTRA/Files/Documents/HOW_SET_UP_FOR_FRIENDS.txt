STEPS


1. Get teamviewer/anydesk/parsec etc
(much faster if i get access to ur PC to do these steps , 
otherwise heaps of explaining/directing and very slow)


2. Get git: https://git-scm.com/downloads
(NEED GIT LFS!!)


3. Git bash in folder next to game files


4. Clone repo: git clone https://github.com/DavoDC/Davo_L4D2_Installation
(the benefit of using git is you dont have to redownload my entire modpack 
if i change it!!! you just have to sync it and it will only download what has changed!!!)


5. Merge into game files


6. Show folder structure - how to switch mods, dont put 2 with same start
- Set left4dead2 compatibility - run as admin!


7. Set launch options in steam
-steam -novid -insecure -high -useallavailablecores -verbose +exec autoexec.cfg +sv_consistency 0 


8. Subscribe to mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1291797268


9. Launch game - test!
- Turn in dev console in settings (only in main menu!)
- Show dev console (tilde ~)
- Show switching between AI  = 'switch' command (alias) in dev console
- Show item drop (press G)
